# Linear Logic

Linear Logic (LL) is a logic system in which deductions "consume" the starting facts in order to reach the new facts. This makes it suitable to modelling logic regarding resources and actors.

## Resources

* [26m video] This lecture provides a good demonstration of LL's applications modelling plans, actions and dialogue. It seems approachable to beginners
	+ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB7rvsfB8AQ
* [20ish pages] This textbook(?) provides an overview of LL. However it does not seem approachable to beginners.
	+ https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-linear/
* [113 page] Design and Implementation of LL Prog Lang disertation
	+ http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.62.8353&rep=rep1&type=pdf
* [10 page] Expressing Heap-shape Contracts in Linear Logic
	+ https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~dpw/papers/gpce06.pdf
	+ Using LL to express function contracts such as a Linked List has no cycles. Seems rather interesting.
* [13 page] Linear Logical Voting Protocols
	+ http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hdeyoung/papers/voteid11.pdf
	+ Modelling voting protocols such as First Past the Post and Hare-Clark Preferential Voting with LL, getting a specification with a free implementation.
	+ Very interesting idea but to a LL noob it doesn't look easier to read that an imperative or functional implementation.

* [119 page] Linear Logic for Linguists
	+ http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~pollard.4/681/crouch.pdf
	+ Asserts itself as an intro to LL for non-logicians, which could be handy. Does say it's meant for linguists, but that doesn't seem like a huge leap for programmers familiar with how prog langs are designed and implemented.
